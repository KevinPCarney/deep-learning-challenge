# deep-learning-challenge
The purpose of this assignment was to use machine learning algorithims, in particular Kmeans to cluster data related to crypto-currency in the pursuit of machine learning.  Principal Component Analysis was applied, as well as scatter plots and elbow graphs to chart the optimal number of clusters.
